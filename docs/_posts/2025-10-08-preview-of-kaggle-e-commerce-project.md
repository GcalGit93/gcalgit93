After my first interview, I wanted to get my hands dirty in the career that I was hoping to get into. It was daunting at first, but it became pretty consuming once I got over the initial hump. I think the end deliverable is pretty substantial. Looking forward to doing more projects and expanding my skillset. Stay tuned!
